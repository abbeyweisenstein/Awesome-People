Hello! 

A fun fact about me that my roommate finds particularly funny is that I was a piece of paper for Halloween when I was around 8 years old. 

It makes more sense when I explain that my two younger siblings were a rock and scissors, so that together we were the game Rock, Paper, Scissors.

However, I find it amusing to wait a little bit before providing further context.

Thanks for reading!
